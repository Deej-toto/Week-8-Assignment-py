# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## Project Description
This project is a data analysis notebook that tracks global COVID-19 trends including confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations. It uses real-world datasets, cleans and processes the data, explores time-based and regional trends, and visualizes insights using Python libraries. The final product presents a structured report suitable for presentation or publication.

## Objectives
- Import and clean global COVID-19 data
- Analyze trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations
- Compare metrics across countries and regions
- Visualize trends using charts and (optionally) maps
- Summarize findings in a clear, narrative format

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- (Optional) plotly, geopandas

## How to Run the Project
1. Download the dataset:
   - [Our World in Data CSV](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-data) or
   - [CSSEGISandData COVID-19 GitHub](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)
2. Save the dataset (e.g., `owid-covid-data.csv`) in the same folder as the notebook.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook using Jupyter or VS Code.
4. Run all cells from top to bottom.
5. Explore the outputs and visualizations.
6. (Optional) Export the notebook to PDF or PowerPoint.

## Data Sources
- [Kaggle COVID-19 Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- [Johns Hopkins University CSSE GitHub](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)

## Insights and Reflections
- Time-series plots reveal different waves of infections per country.
- Vaccination rollouts vary significantly across regions.
- Some countries with high case counts had relatively low death rates.
- Interactive visualizations (optional) enhance understanding of geographic trends.
- Cleaning real-world data is crucial and often time-consuming.
